			<p>It&rsquo;s a hidden museum of baseball lore, a mausoleum of Colorado history.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Soak it all in,&rdquo; said Paul Parker, the Rockies&rsquo; official historian.</p>
			<p>NLCS champagne bottles; Eric Young&rsquo;s jersey from when he homered in the first-ever Rockies home at-bat; the original Dinger costume; the base upon which Troy Tulowitzki recorded an unassisted triple play; racks of game-worn uniforms; a boatload of bobbleheads; and a bevy of bats and balls, some autographed by Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; Parker said, &ldquo;is it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>There it is.</p>
			<p>The seat.</p>
			<p>More than a quarter-century later, Colorado baseball fans still talk, and gawk, about the Joey Meyer home run. It&rsquo;s our fish tale.</p>
			<p>On the night of June 2, 1987, six summers before the Rockies&rsquo; inaugural season, the Triple-A Denver Zephyrs hosted the grammatically incorrect Buffalo Bisons at Mile High Stadium.</p>
			<p>In the seventh inning, a slider hovered in front of Meyer, a Zephyrs slugger, and he thwacked that thing so.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was just unbelievable,&rdquo; said Denverite Mark Danuser, who sat in the third-base stands that night, &ldquo;because it just didn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It smacked an empty seat in an empty second deck in left field, above Rich Jackson&rsquo;s name in the Broncos&rsquo; Ring of Fame. An engineer soon determined the home run traveled 582 feet.</p>
			<p>Five-hundred and eighty-two feet!</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It was something that I heard about in my childhood, the way that people heard about Babe Ruth calling his shot,&rdquo; said 30-year-old baseball fanatic Tyler Maun, who grew up playing the game in the thin air of Denver. &ldquo;You just kind of heard these whispers of like &mdash; ‘Man, you should&rsquo;ve seen this time when Joey Meyer hit a home run.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s like a Denver baseball legend.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As the historian Parker and many others recall, the Zephyrs replaced that seat with one of a different color, so fans would always see just how far Meyer once hit a ball.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Every time I was at the stadium after that game,&rdquo; Gov. John Hickenlooper said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d look up at the orange seat and marvel that someone could hit a ball that high and that far.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When Mile High was torn down in 2002, Parker asked for the Meyer seat.</p>
			<p>And they sent him the seat he showed me that day, a blue stadium chair. They explained to him it was the original seat the homer hit &mdash; replaced in the stands by an orange one, to mark the spot.</p>

			<p>I was fascinated. I began researching the homer, asking around. I read some old stories, most mentioning the orange seat in the sea of blue &mdash; though a few mentioned the original seat was painted Zephyrs&rsquo; green.</p>
			<p>Painted green?</p>
			<p>I e-mailed my friend Derrick Goold, a native Coloradan and acclaimed baseball writer in St. Louis. I told him I was writing about the famous homer, and he e-mailed back: &ldquo;Joey Meyer! Green seat!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Goold isn&rsquo;t one of those guys to flippantly remember baseball history.</p>
			<p>Then again, the governor himself said the seat was orange.</p>
			<p>Just what was going on here?</p>
			<p>What color was the seat before &mdash; and after &mdash; the home run?</p>
			<p>Was Parker&rsquo;s seat at Coors Field really the original seat where the ball actually landed?</p>
			<p>The fish tale was getting fishy.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>A crowd of 1,404 scattered about Mile High Stadium that Tuesday, and as Meyer came to bat in the seventh inning, he wasn&rsquo;t holding his own bat.</p>
			<p>See, the previous season, the Milwaukee Brewers traded for Donnie Scott, a minor leaguer in the Baltimore Orioles system. Scott was sent down to Denver. He liked Meyer&rsquo;s lumber, so Scott offered to swap him some bats used by a Baltimore player &mdash; and as Meyer said, &ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t take a couple of bats from Cal Ripken?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Yep. Joey Meyer hit his legendary home run with a bat that belonged to a legend.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The one regret I had was that I wish I didn&rsquo;t use the bat the next day,&rdquo; Meyer said. &ldquo;My baseball superstitions became stronger than logic. I broke it on the first at-bat the next day. It would have been something to keep, intact.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>They even work graveyard shifts in paradise.</p>
			<p>Meyer, 53, works security overnight at a hospital in Maui.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I do it for the insurance for me and my wife,&rdquo; he said in his native Hawaiian accent and cadence.</p>
			<p>Meyer is the father of seven. He doesn&rsquo;t tell co-workers of his baseball career. Meyer played parts of 1988 and 1989 with Milwaukee.</p>
			<p>Sometimes he will catch a televised game from the mainland and spot an old teammate, now a coach or manager, still wedged into a big-league uniform.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I just smile,&rdquo; Meyer said. &ldquo;It takes me back.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Twenty-eight Junes ago, Meyer had prospect written all over him, though that would have taken a while. He was large. The slugger was listed at 6-foot-3 and 260 round pounds. And with his dark mustache and green cap, he was reminiscent of a portly protagonist from &ldquo;A Confederacy of Dunces,&rdquo; Ignatius J. Reilly, whose body the author described as &ldquo;shifting from one hip to another in his lumbering, elephantine fashion.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>But he could sure hit. For the Zephyrs in 1987, Meyer swatted 29 homers and drove in 92 runs &mdash; in only 79 games played.</p>
			<p>The designated hitter batted .311 and his on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) was 1.069. To put this in perspective, when the New York Yankees&rsquo; Alex Rodriguez won the MVP award in 2007, his OPS was 1.067.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of course it was disappointing not to be able to, you know, to play in the big leagues the way everybody hopes to,&rdquo; said Meyer, who retired with 18 home runs for Milwaukee. &ldquo;But the older I get, the more you appreciate that not too many guys get to do it &mdash; and it was a fun ride. And what happened in Denver is special.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>On the mound in the seventh inning was Mike Murphy, the poor sap who slung the slider.</p>
			<p>Meyer actually hit three homers that famous night, the first one off John Farrell, who later managed the Boston Red Sox to the 2013 World Series championship.</p>
			<p>Murphy had a 2-2 count on Meyer, and then &hellip;</p>
			<p>A fling and a swing and a crack and a thwack.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I stood up in the dugout,&rdquo; Zephyrs pitcher Mark Knudson said, &ldquo;and you know that little button on the top of your hat? I think that embedded the button into my skull because I hit the ceiling. I remember grabbing my head and watching the ball. Disbelief was really the word. And I&rsquo;m just telling guys, ‘Listen, no one&rsquo;s ever done that before.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d grown up in Denver and in that stadium. It was awe-inspiring.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>When I spoke to former Zephyrs executive Robert Howsam, he kept referring to the 582-foot homer as a &ldquo;monster.&rdquo; In a way, it was the Loch Ness Monster.</p>
			<p>Most Denverites have only heard of the home run. It&rsquo;s not online. I&rsquo;d never seen the footage before, and neither had my Denver baseball buddies.</p>
			<p>So I reached out to some cohorts at KCNC-Channel 4, and they soon discovered the old tape and sent me a copy. The footage was grainy, and the camera operator actually lost the trajectory of the batted ball.</p>

			 <p>But I watched and rewatched. And I just couldn&rsquo;t tell the color of the second-deck seats. They looked dark, possibly blue, surrounded by yellowish space; but like an optical illusion, they then looked yellow, surrounded by darkish space.</p>
			<p>On the Saturday of July 4, we watched the video at The Denver Post. Torin Berge, a deputy sports editor, overheard the deep voice of the public-address man on the video.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Doug!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Doug was Doug Montgomery, his old pal who worked for the team. So Torin texted him about the seat-color controversy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That seat was green,&rdquo; Montgomery wrote back. &ldquo;Quote me on it. Assistant media relations director in 1987.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>This was getting rather confusing, and I was getting rather obsessed.</p>
			<p>I had to find the guy who gave the Rockies&rsquo; historian the blue seat.</p>
			<p>His name is Gary Jones, the Mile High Stadium operations manager.</p>
			<p>Surely he would know the true story.</p>
			<p>But there were 56 Gary Joneses in the White Pages. I cold-called some. Nothing. I asked a dozen people who might have known him. Nada. I even considered calling Chipper Jones, on the off-chance they were related. Or just standing at Speer and Market and screaming: &ldquo;DOES ANYONE KNOW GARY JONES?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>No one had a number for the guy. Or could even remember his wife&rsquo;s name. A couple of people wondered whether he had died.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>The only person in the stadium who didn&rsquo;t see the Joey Meyer homer was Joey Meyer.</p>
			<p>Not one to show up a pitcher, he simply started trotting.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When I hit third base, (Zephyrs manager Terry) Bevington was yelling at me that I hit the upper deck,&rdquo; Meyer recalled. &ldquo;But he was a jokester, so you never could tell if he was serious or not.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>On the night of July 4, I stayed in. I read online articles until my blue eyes became bleary.</p>
			<p>One story said the Meyer homer landed in Section 338, Row 3, Seat 9. But the historian Parker&rsquo;s seat was Seat 7.</p>
			<p>Someone was wrong, right?</p>
			<p>In a story from September 1990, The Denver Post referred to the seat as painted green. Then in April 1991, the Rocky Mountain News referred to the orange seat in the blue section, in a story written by a young Adam Schefter.</p>
			<p>By April 1993, the Rockies&rsquo; first season, the Joey Meyer seat was gone, the papers explained. Just a sea of blue seats.</p>
			<p>The next year, though, the papers said the orange seat sprouted back up.</p>
			<p>It was all so confusing.</p>
			<p>Which seat was the actual seat Meyer&rsquo;s homer hit?</p>
			<p>If only I could find this Gary Jones.</p>
			<p>The next morning, I drove to the memorabilia mecca that is Bill&rsquo;s Sports Collectibles on Broadway. There had to be some clues there.</p>
			<p>I sifted through old baseball cards, books, programs and scorecards for nearly two hours. I was worn down and ready to leave, when I spotted some Zephyrs team photos.</p>
			<p>I furiously flipped through a stack of glossy pics, and there it was &mdash; the 1987 team. I later confirmed with Knudson that, indeed, the team photo was taken later in the 1987 season, after June 2.</p>
			<p>Sure enough, above the posing players, was Rich Jackson&rsquo;s name in the Broncos&rsquo; Ring of Fame. And three rows above the name was &hellip; a green painted seat, amongst the yellow bleacher benches.</p>
			<p>It was green!</p>

			<p>Moments later I found the 1992 team photo. This was taken from a different angle, but in the faint upper-left corner of the picture, you could again see Rich Jackson&rsquo;s name.</p>
			<p>And above it was a sea of blue seats, with an orange speck, three rows up.</p>
			<p>It was orange!</p>
			<p>I finally had photo evidence to back up everything. I soon corroborated it with a black-and-white picture I found in The Post&rsquo;s photo archives, which appeared to be of Meyer, standing at the spot of the homer.</p>
			<p>Indeed, he was near bleacher benches &mdash; not individual seats.</p>
			<p>So, if the second deck had bleachers in 1987, then the historian Parker&rsquo;s blue chair could not be what Meyer&rsquo;s homer hit.</p>
			<p>Thus, where in the world was the actual green-painted seat from the yellow bleachers?</p>
			<p>The next morning, I missed a phone call. It was from Denver Parks and Recreation. They had tracked down a number for a former employee I&rsquo;d inquired about &mdash; ol&rsquo; Gary Jones.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>I awaited my white whale.</p>
			<p>And then, there he was.</p>
			<p>Seventy-year-old Gary Jones.</p>
			<p>He confirmed the 1990-91 Mile High renovation of the second deck &mdash; &ldquo;We got all brand new chairs. &hellip; It was a bench with curved backs before the new seats.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He concluded that the historian Parker&rsquo;s blue seat was likely the one replaced by the lone orange seat, before the 1991 season &mdash; and not the seat hit by Meyer in 1987.</p>
			<p>So, I had to know: What happened to the original yellow benches, notably the seat painted green?</p>
			<p>Gary Jones paused, as did my heart.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he revealed. &ldquo;I think they ended up at the raceway south of Pueblo.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A raceway? South of Pueblo?</p>
			<p>&ldquo;On the west side of the road. It&rsquo;s closed now&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tell you the name of it, but it&rsquo;s 15, 20 miles south of Pueblo. I know a big portion of our seats went down there for their bleachers. It was an oval track. I don&rsquo;t think the seats are there anymore, but they still have the risers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>You&rsquo;re killin&rsquo; me, Gary Jones.</p>
			<p>Denver Post writer Nick Groke had become similarly gripped by my green seat saga. So Groke and I joined forces to find the dang thing.</p>
			<p>In the coming days, we called and e-mailed seemingly every track in Pueblo, then near Pueblo and pretty soon in the same time zone as Pueblo. Nope, no one knew.</p>
			<p>But then, an auto club president in Lamar could&rsquo;ve sworn that the Broncos&rsquo; bleachers went to a track in Mosca. You know, Mosca &mdash; in the hills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains near Alamosa. So we found the track&rsquo;s old owners, the McCormicks, and I caught Linda Mac on the phone.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So &hellip; do you know anything about Mile High Stadium bleachers going to the track?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A meteorologist could&rsquo;ve measured the precipitation under my arm pits.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She hadn&rsquo;t heard a thing. Neither had her husband.</p>
			<p>In the coming days, we got a bunch of &ldquo;no, buts&rdquo; &mdash; everyone thought someone else got the Mile High seats. We tirelessly researched track histories, round and round, upon an oval boulevard of broken dreams.</p>
			<p>I was losing sleep. My mind too. I called Gary Jones again, and he then remembered that some of the bleachers were also sold at the time. He even said the name of a company, American Seating, which, of course, sounded fake. But it wasn&rsquo;t, and an old guy there put me in touch with a guy in New Jersey named Steve, who put me in touch with a guy in Illinois named Grant, who was actually on the job at Mile High in 1990 and 1991.</p>
			<p>Grant couldn&rsquo;t remember exactly where they went, but possibly Tennessee?</p>

			<p>At 1 a.m. one night, I just I started asking Twitter followers if they knew anything about a track in Pueblo or the Joey Meyer seat or cures for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Amy in Pueblo was particularly nice, and I sent her the original Gary Jones quote about the possible Pueblo track. She said, &ldquo;based on his description, if you turn ‘15-20 miles south of Pueblo&rsquo; to the ‘north,&rsquo; he then described PPIR to a T.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Pikes Peak International Raceway!</p>
			<p>PPIR was opened in 1997. But wait, there was originally a horse racing track there &mdash; Pikes Peak Meadows. Maybe Jones meant a horse track? I proceeded to read dozens of old articles about the track, which was re-opened, briefly, in the early 1990s. Everything seemed to make sense. This was it, right?</p>
			<p>The name Greg Wry kept popping up in articles &mdash; he was the track&rsquo;s PR guy, and a horseracing lifer who went by &ldquo;Boomer.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Denver Post librarian tracked him down in Florida. I called and got an automated voice mail. I left a message. I left a second message. And then, on Saturday, July 11th, I answered the phone and heard a deep voice tell me, &ldquo;This is Boomer.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>We chit-chatted for a minute when, all of a sudden, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to call you back.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Boomer, no! Where are you going?</p>
			<p>Thirty-four minutes passed.</p>
			<p>He then indeed called me back.</p>
			<p>I asked him about Mile High seats, possibly once installed at the race track.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I have not heard of that,&rdquo; Boomer said, breaking my heart.</p>

	        <p class ="slideshow-intro">Tyler Maun&rsquo;s hat was a couple years older than Tyler Maun.
					The 30-year-old Denverite, sipping miso soup at a local sushi spot, wore a Denver Bears minor league hat from the early 1980s. It&rsquo;s one of 100 fitted baseball hats the guy owns, and each has a story.
					&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people get how much has happened here in baseball history,&rdquo; said Maun, a former minor-league broadcaster who has two baseball podcasts. &ldquo;I kind of seized on the melding of the weird civic pride that people from Denver have &mdash; I&rsquo;m admittedly one of those weirdos &mdash; and then being obsessed with baseball.&rdquo;
					Maun mentioned numerous factoids about Denver&rsquo;s minor league history. In the 1930s, for instance, this very newspaper hosted a tournament for numerous black teams and black players. Satchel Paige pitched here.
					Really, Denver baseball goes back to 1862, when some local hospital workers played games against the city&rsquo;s founding fathers. Local historian Jay Sanford has the box scores.
					Numerous teams came and went, but the 1947 return of the Denver Bears solidified the Mile High city as a minor league town &mdash; until it became a major league town. By 1955, the Bears became Triple-A. The Yankees affiliate featured Tony Kubek, Ralph Terry, Ryne Duren and Marv Thronberry, who hit 42 home runs in 1956. In the following decades, budding stars such as Andre Dawson and Tim Raines and Barry Larkin and Eric Davis played here. After the 1984 season, the team&rsquo;s name was changed to the Zephyrs, and in the late 1980s, the Brewers affiliate thrived with sluggers such as Gary Sheffield, John Jaha and, of course, Joey Meyer.
					The Zephyrs moved out of Mile High Stadium, down to New Orleans, after the 1992 season. The Colorado Rockies moved in.</p>

			<p>Jim Conrad and Irv Brown called the game for a local television broadcast that night:</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Bottom of the seventh. Two runs already in. And the Z&rsquo;s lead it 8-7 in a see-saw affair...</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh my! That&rsquo;s the longest one yet. Upper deck!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh my. Oh my! The upper deck in left field. That may be the first one I&rsquo;ve ever seen in the upper deck.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I saw a guy named Bill Pinckard hit one like that. But never in modern times. That thing &mdash; that thing has to be more than 450.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;First one I&rsquo;ve ever seen in the upper deck. Unbelievable.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading sansline">&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;</h3>
			
			<p>Maybe this is all just part of the homer&rsquo;s mythology and mystery.</p>
			<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s better that we can&rsquo;t find the seat, for it adds to the lore.</p>
			<p>The more I thought about it, the more I thought about all the mysteries involving the home run. For one, we don&rsquo;t know how much the thin air allowed the ball to soar. Moreover, the pitcher Mark Knudson firmly believes that baseballs were juiced in the 1987 season, in the minors and majors. It&rsquo;s an oft-debated topic, because as writer Larry Granillo pointed out, 28 major-league players hit 30 or more homers in 1987, while only five players did so in 1988.</p>
			<p>Also, in 1986, there had never been more homers hit in the majors, yet the following season, that number was up 20 percent. In 1987, rookie Mark McGwire hit 49, while Wade Boggs, who never before or after hit more than 11 homers, slugged 24.</p>
			<p>Was this part of why the Meyer ball went so far?</p>
			<p>And then there&rsquo;s the question we&rsquo;ve been avoiding &mdash; just how far did it really go? The measuring of home runs was antiquated in 1987, when engineers said Meyer&rsquo;s homer went 582 feet. Then consider that in all the years of baseball at Coors Field, the farthest home run ever hit there, according to the Rockies, was &ldquo;just&rdquo; 496 feet, by Mike Piazza in 1997. You&rsquo;re telling me that Meyer&rsquo;s homer went 86 feet farther than that one?</p>

			<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s better that we don&rsquo;t have all the answers. That we don&rsquo;t have the seat. Maybe it&rsquo;s better if we just let Joey Meyer&rsquo;s home run be Denver&rsquo;s fish tale.</p>
			<p>On the phone from Maui, Meyer talked about Ripken, whose bat he used to hit the homer. When Ripken retired, Meyer explained, Ripken was asked how he wanted to be remembered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;To be remembered at all is pretty special,&rdquo; Ripken said.</p>
			<p>Joey Meyer, he of Denver sports lore, is forever remembered for the home run that hit a seat in the second deck.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awesome &mdash; that home run was a split-second,&rdquo; Meyer said, &ldquo;and now, so many years later, it&rsquo;s something people are talking about.&rdquo;</p>
