			<p>It was the dying coach&rsquo;s request.</p>
			<p>Martin Hernandez, a beloved Eaton High School assistant, taught generations of boys the knuckle curve &hellip; and courage. Even his own son, Todd, who grew up in the dugouts of this tiny town.</p>
			<p>Coach Hernandez was diabetic. Toward the end, after his right leg below his knee was amputated, he would come to games in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank. When the Eaton Reds won the 2003 Class 3A state championship, they had their bus stop at the Hernandez home so the boys could share the big moment with their old coach. Later that year, Hernandez was back in his uniform &mdash; in an open casket.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget the sight of it,&rdquo; said longtime friend Jim Danley, Eaton&rsquo;s head coach. &ldquo;It was emblematic of his dedication and his love for Eaton baseball.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>How they love their baseball here.</p>

			<p>This lifestyle and lifeblood &mdash; it&rsquo;s Indiana and basketball, Texas and football. In this nook of a Colorado town about an hour north of Denver, where the population (4,647) is close to the elevation (4,839 feet), they live for the game &mdash; and, so it seems, they die with the game. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;You grow up with that pride,&rdquo; said Todd Hernandez, 42, who played for Eaton and now coaches one of its summer teams. &ldquo;Coach Danley always said that those five letters on the front of your jersey should mean something. When you put on a uniform, you&rsquo;ve got Eaton on the front, and there&rsquo;s a target on the back. </p>

Since 1990, only two times has Eaton failed to win its league. Since he became head coach in 1972, Danley&rsquo;s teams have won an astounding 83.1 percent of its games. </p>

			<p>As I pulled into town, sure enough, I was welcomed by the image of a father and a son playing catch in a park. </p>
			<p>And a manure stench.</p>
			<p>It smells here.</p>
			<p>Eaton High School features adjacent baseball fields, and on this afternoon, the first field was scattered with fresh-faced freshmen-to-be, one kid tossing up a ball, bending his back, pinging the ball high into the air for outfielders to shag. One of the boys on the field was Todd Hernandez&rsquo;s son, Mason &mdash; Martin&rsquo;s grandson. Another boy stood upon the bullpen rubber, the wiry, brown grass crawling up around his ankles. After this pixie pitcher heaved a pitch, he proclaimed to the catcher, &ldquo;I got my fingertips in it!&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Soon I would realize he was experimenting with the knuckle curve, one of the nuances of the Eaton Way. </p>
			<p>On the varsity field, the big kids prepared for a big game. Danley&rsquo;s Reds were in the state tournament, yet again. I met Chris Blaser, the team&rsquo;s athletic trainer. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Pretty much a one-stoplight town,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You do something in the morning, and your parents know about it by the time the night&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; </p>

			 <p>Blaser was in his first season with the team, and his ballcap &mdash; with red pinstripes, a red bill and a red E &mdash; was white and bright, which was sort of like spotting a rare ivory-billed woodpecker. See, the hats the varsity boys wear are the same hats they first receive, over on the other field. Eaton starts ‘em young here, and players keep the same hat along for the ride. So by the time the boys are upperclassmen, their hats are a spectrum of browns, dirtied by a decade of diamonds and dusty dugouts. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;It becomes really uncool to have a white hat,&rdquo; Danley explained. </p>
			<p>Also, the hats are fitted at a young age &mdash; champions don&rsquo;t wear snap-back hats &mdash; so as the boys&rsquo; heads grow, they simply make a cut in the back of the hat, which allows it to expand in size. </p>
			<p>In a way, an old hat is old hat here. But it&rsquo;s a status symbol, like the Eaton letter jacket. </p>

			<p>Danley, 68, was raised in the area, 13 miles down the road in Gill, an unincorporated community. And he was raised on the game. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;My favorite sport from the day I first picked up a baseball,&rdquo; he said. </p>
			<p>His father, Gilbert, was a pilot whose license was signed in 1931 by Orville Wright. Gilbert was a tough man but cool too. Unflappable. Danley&rsquo;s dad would have 5-year-old Jim play catch with the Hispanics in Gill &ldquo;because they knew how to throw properly. He wanted to make sure I got it right.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>In the spring of 1969, Jim became an Eaton assistant baseball coach. He earned the head gig in 1972. His teams were good, winning the league and such, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1994 that they won their first state championship. </p>
			<p>Danley&rsquo;s son, Kirk, played second base for the Reds that season. Gilbert was there too. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;I can see him right there, in the old bleachers, with his straw hat, just taking in every little thing,&rdquo; Jim Danley said. &ldquo;I see that (image of him) a lot. &hellip; To have them be a part of it made it very much a family event. It was one of the best moments of my life.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>It was the lone Reds championship Gilbert would see. </p>
			
			<h3 class="subheading">Pitching makes Eaton prosper </h3>
			
			<p>In Eaton, soon after a nurse cuts the cord, babies are taught to pull the string on a changeup. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We joke about the fact that if you&rsquo;re born in Eaton, you&rsquo;re a pitcher until we tell you you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Danley said. &ldquo;Our feeling is: Baseball is a sport that is dominated by the pitching position. It&rsquo;s very difficult to stay consistent if you don&rsquo;t have guys on the mound who are tough, resilient and experienced. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;And Bear Bryant was right in football: You&rsquo;ve got to stop losing before you can start winning. So our view is: Pitching and defense is a way to stop losing.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>Spring after spring, along with coach Martin Hernandez, Danley taught pitching passionately and properly, as his father would want. He would watch pitchers on TV with the same microscopes in his corneas. And so, as the story goes, a game in 1986 changed the way Eaton played the game. It was Oklahoma State playing in the College World Series in Omaha, and Danley was watching when the Cowboys&rsquo; pitcher unleashed this pitch. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;And as soon as I saw that, I thought, ‘Ah, he&rsquo;s throwing an illegal pitch,&rsquo; &rdquo; Danley said. &ldquo;I thought it was a spitter. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;So I thought, I got to go down there and see this guy. I drove to Oklahoma State to talk to coach Tom Holliday, Matt&rsquo;s dad. I talked to the coach on Saturday, and he said, ‘Well, he&rsquo;s just throwing a curveball,&rsquo; and I said, ‘I think it&rsquo;s a little more than a curveball.&rsquo; He kind of looks at me and winks and says, ‘Come in tomorrow morning around 8 o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
			<p>What happened next sounds like something out of the fictional Sidd Finch story, when outsiders were allowed into a private area to watch Finch&rsquo;s 168 mph pitch. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;He brings him in and the guy starts throwing an 82, 83 mph fastball, nothing special, just very average college stuff,&rdquo; Danley recalled. &ldquo;And then (Holliday) said, ‘All right, throw him one.&rsquo; And the ball came in just like the 82, 83 one &mdash; but it just dropped like a rock.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>The knuckle curve. </p>
			<p>Get Danley talking about this thing, and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re on barstools. He will show you how to properly place your fingernails along the seams, and how it will spin forward, seven times, maybe eight, &ldquo;and then it&rsquo;ll snap.&rdquo; Or he will regale you with old stories about long-ago pitchers such as Jesse Haines from St. Louis&rsquo; Gashouse Gang, one of the first to throw the pitch. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;At that time (in 1986), it was thought to be an old man&rsquo;s pitch, a way you hang on in the majors,&rdquo; Danley said. &ldquo;But I reasoned, if he has a 19-year-old guy doing it, why in the world couldn&rsquo;t we have 12- and 13-year-olds do it? &hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t hurt the arm, so we teach that pitch. We learned how to teach it. It took a long time to figure out the best way to do it, a lot of trial and error. The knuckle curve is a big pitch for us, and that&rsquo;s maybe one of the things that separates us from most programs.&rdquo; </p>

			<p>Lane Greiman was 10 when he first learned the knuckle curve.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was kind of rough for me &mdash; I used to be a small kid and didn&rsquo;t have very big hands,&rdquo; he said. By eighth grade, he could throw the knuckle curve for strikes, and this past spring the 6-foot senior Greiman was named the Class 3A player of the year by The Denver Post.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was a lot of work and getting used to it,&rdquo; Greiman said of the pitch. &ldquo;But it enhances everything. Once you have that pitch, you can get batters off (anticipating) fastballs. And it&rsquo;s an off-speed pitch that doesn&rsquo;t hurt your arm. It&rsquo;s really effective.&rdquo;</p>
			
			<h3 class="subheading">Old players instruct new players </h3>
			
			<p>It&rsquo;s cash or check only at Steven&rsquo;s Grill, but don&rsquo;t end up on the bad check list, because that thing is laminated. </p>
			<p>On a sign inside, the phone number doesn&rsquo;t have an area code; on the sign outside, it advertises &ldquo;lunch and supper.&rdquo; But regardless of what time you arrive at Steve Schlotthauer&rsquo;s greasy spoon, you have to get a burger. </p>
			<p>And if you have a Mitch Unrein appetite &mdash; the ol&rsquo; Broncos fan favorite is a native son &mdash; order &ldquo;The George.&rdquo; This gastronomical gas-giver has four cheeseburgers stacked like pancakes between a bun, inspired by the boxer George Foreman, who once said that he trained by eating cheeseburgers. It costs $7.60. </p>
			<p>Schlotthauer is also something of a curator. His place is part greasy spoon, part Guggenheim. The walls of his diner feature framed photos, jerseys and articles about Eaton, as well as one enormous, air-brushed painting of the team celebrating another state title. </p>
			<p>And next to this is a framed white jersey with red pinstripes. It&rsquo;s No. 7. DANLEY. And the Sharpied autograph on it reads &ldquo;Coach Danley.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Danley has an aura about him. Sure, he&rsquo;s a farmer, quick with a quip, a regular fellow. But when it comes to baseball, he&rsquo;s the godfather here, looming like this enormous framed jersey above boys eating burgers. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d see him when you&rsquo;re playing, like 12 years old, and you&rsquo;re looking over like, ‘Who is that guy?&rsquo; &rdquo; remembered Matt Burkart, a key player on this season&rsquo;s state champs. &ldquo;You go into the dugout and ask your coach. And he says, ‘That&rsquo;s seven.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
			<p>Danley is Eaton baseball. He doesn&rsquo;t coach a team; he coaches a culture. And it starts with T-ball, really. After that the boys enter the youth program, teams coached by Kirk Danley, Todd Hernandez and other Jim Danley disciples. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s done at Eaton,&rdquo; Kirk Danley said matter-of-factly about the old players coming back to coach the new ones. </p>
			<p>This summer, Greiman is helping coach what is called the Eaton Morning League, a program for kids as young as 7. Sometimes, he&rsquo;ll wear his dirty hat.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We play baseball and teach them lessons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we have one whole day dedicated to the knuckle curve.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Seeing the winning firsthand, it definitely plants a seed. You&rsquo;re instantly hooked,&rdquo; said Burkart, who has his clichés down like a veteran big-leaguer. &ldquo;You want to get on the train, and you want to push it farther than it&rsquo;s ever been.&rdquo; </p>
			
			<h3 class="subheading">Mound with more meaning </h3>
			
			<p>It&rsquo;s a Thursday in early June. The 8 p.m. sun hangs like a curveball just above the outfield, illuminating clouds like stadium lights. In the distance, a swing pings. Over there, a ball hits a mitt, as a father plays catch with his kin. It&rsquo;s all so perfect. </p>
			<p>Well, except that stench. </p>
			<p>I walked toward the varsity field. Three high schoolers took cuts in the cage, right behind the dusty bleachers. The field was empty. I took a quick glimpse at the pitcher&rsquo;s mound, where innumerable knuckle curves have baffled batters since the heyday of Martin Hernandez, the beloved assistant coach who never stopped smiling, even when they took his leg. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a guy who gave his life to Eaton baseball &mdash; time, effort, money,&rdquo; Danley said of Todd&rsquo;s dad and 14-year-old Mason&rsquo;s grandfather. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything that Martin Hernandez wouldn&rsquo;t do for us. &hellip; What a legacy.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Martin is buried in his uniform at Eaton Cemetery, which is on a clay hill. It just so happens that some of the best clay and dirt in the area come from the cemetery. So, when they dig a grave, they pile the excess dirt in a special section of the cemetery. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;And we use it for our pitching mounds,&rdquo; Danley said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s top-level clay, just the right mixture. Whenever we have to firm up the mounds, we take a truck, go out and visit the old coach.&rdquo; </p>
