			<p>&ldquo;He was taking part in the hora and all the chazerai at your typical Bar Mitzvah,&rdquo; said Weiss, now 19, using a word that means &ldquo;the usual stuff&rdquo; in Yiddish. &ldquo;He jumped right in and didn&rsquo;t look back.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>During spring trainings in Florida, Michael Weiss was the Minnesota Twins&rsquo; doctor; one Twin became part of the doctor&rsquo;s family.</p>
			<p>LaTroy Hawkins, today a Colorado Rockies relief pitcher, would dine at the Weiss household, sometimes attending Sammy&rsquo;s youth baseball games &mdash; an ump once even ejected the passionate big-leaguer from the stands. When Hawkins left the Twins to sign with the Chicago Cubs for the 2004 season, a heartbroken Sammy refused to talk to him for a month. When Dr. Weiss himself underwent a major surgery, Hawkins stayed with the family at the hospital for 10 hours.</p>
			<p>And when 13-year-old Sammy had his Bar Mitzvah in 2008, Hawkins, his wife and daughter all flew to Florida, even though it was Hawkins&rsquo; birthday weekend.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In a Jewish kid&rsquo;s life, a Bar or Bat Mitzvah is basically the thing you work up to,&rdquo; Sammy said. &ldquo;I think he felt somewhat of an ownership, almost a pseudo-parental-fraternal role for me. &hellip; But it&rsquo;s not even as much about having a professional baseball player as a friend, but more the quality of person that he is. You just absorb every single characteristic of himself into you, and as a kid, you can mold yourself in his image.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The story about LaTroy and Sammy is cool on its own. But then consider that Hawkins has influenced so many others just like Sammy. The 42-year-old Rockies reliever has passed down his passion for playing baseball and living life the right way.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m done playing, I don&rsquo;t care about having a career ERA of whatever,&rdquo; Hawkins said recently in the Rockies clubhouse. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t care about never winning a World Series. I won&rsquo;t care about any of that. The only thing I&rsquo;ll care about is what my teammates thought of me, and the managers, pitching coaches, general managers and all the people I came in contact with. I care what they think of me. &hellip;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Generational pitcher</h3>
			<p>Hawkins &mdash; little-known fact &mdash; was warming up in the bullpen when Babe Ruth called his shot.</p>
			<p>Kidding aside, he is 42 and the oldest player in baseball. When the Rockies&rsquo; relievers grew beards this spring, the resident graybeard indeed had a gray beard. Hawk, as they call him, has had a teammate born as long ago as 1956 (Paul Molitor) and as recently as 1991 &mdash; current Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado, born the same year Hawkins was drafted.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that even LaTroy would have said, 15 years ago, that he&rsquo;d be the oldest guy in the big leagues still pitching &mdash; and (doing so) late in games,&rdquo; said the Hall of Famer Molitor, now the Minnesota manager. &ldquo;But because of the way he learned at a young age how to work, he&rsquo;s found a way to do things that not a lot of pitchers have been able to do.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s as good a guy as you&rsquo;d want to have around your team, I know that.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hawkins was a rookie with the Twins in the spring of 1995, about seven months before Sammy was born, a point Sammy often reminds the reliever.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When you came up back then in baseball, it&rsquo;s kind of crazy, but you didn&rsquo;t speak unless you were spoken to,&rdquo; Hawkins recalled.</p>
			<p>The Minnesota clubhouse was inflated by the plump personalities of Kirby Puckett, Chuck Knoblauch and Pedro Muñoz, who referred to LaTroy Hawkins as Bleeping Rookie.</p>
			<p>Puckett was from Chicago, near Hawkins&rsquo; hometown of Gary, Ind. Sure, the superstar made the kid carry his bags, but he also cared for the kid.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He made it seem like he&rsquo;d change our diapers,&rdquo; Hawkins explained.</p>

			 <p>Now, major-leaguers don&rsquo;t buy off the rack. Puckett, Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, Eddie Murray, they all went to PortaBella. It&rsquo;s in midtown Manhattan, near the Grand Hyatt. In 1995, Puckett arrived with a rookie and bought the kid his first suit.</p>
			<p>And so, every season, Hawkins takes first-year pitchers on his team to buy them suits. They&rsquo;ll get them tailored just so, and the veteran shows them shoes that match with certain belts. But this all isn&rsquo;t a gift; it&rsquo;s a lesson. This is how you dress, feel and act when you&rsquo;re a big-leaguer.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Kirby Puckett taught him, so he continues the tradition,&rdquo; said PortaBella owner Joe Oks, in his quick-paced New York accent. &ldquo;I remember LaTroy well. Good pitcher for a lot of years, a great guy, family guy. Very outgoing but a very humble person. &hellip; He&rsquo;s never changed in all the years I&rsquo;ve known him. I wish he would keep pitching &mdash; one more year&rsquo;s not gonna hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A couple of years back, two-time Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana came up to Hawkins and said, &ldquo;Remember this?&rdquo; It was a suit &mdash; the one Hawk bought the rookie Santana in 2000.</p>
			<p>And Yohan Flande? He grew up in a poor fishing village in the Dominican Republic. He didn&rsquo;t make the major leagues until he was 28, during the 2014 season with the Rockies. He has been in Triple-A for much of this season.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And when I was doing my rehab in Albuquerque,&rdquo; Hawk said, &ldquo;every day he thanked me for the suit.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Whenever a guy thanks me, I say, &lsquo;Hey, when you get a chance, make sure you do that for somebody else.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Hawkins is old-school, a school he likes to school. He gets perturbed when players don&rsquo;t tip the clubhouse guys. It&rsquo;s a pet peeve of his when teammates don&rsquo;t call a hotel bellman to get their bags &mdash; not because of the luxury of it, but because the tip is &ldquo;putting money in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sometimes guys will split the bill at restaurants, and Hawk remembers a time when a lone teammate would happily buy dinner for everyone at the table. And if a band&rsquo;s music is blaring too loud in the clubhouse, as Kings of Leon was the other day, Hawkins will turn it down if he&rsquo;s being interviewed, out of respect for the reporter.</p>
			<p>In some ways, Hawkins is the old man who screams to the kids, &ldquo;Get off my lawn!&rdquo; Except, his lawn is a major-league field, and the kids are teammates he&rsquo;s trying to make as virtuous as they are prodigious players.</p>
			<p>On May 25, Rockies rookie pitcher Eddie Butler started at Cincinnati, and in the triangularly cramped corner of the visiting clubhouse, his locker was next to that of Hawkins, who watched the kid like, well, a hawk.</p>
			<p>In a postgame interview, Butler said &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;me&rdquo; five times in about two minutes. Hawk scowled.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; he said after the reporters left, &ldquo;did you say anything about your teammates?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the rookie said, hanging his head.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Did you say anything about how your team won?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So basically, you (talked about yourself) for two minutes?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Butler then asked reporters if he could do another interview.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We had talked about it before,&rdquo; Hawkins later said. &ldquo;I heard some stuff about his interviews. I listened and it was a decent interview, but he didn&rsquo;t give any credit to his teammates! And we had talked about that. I know you can get into the moment during an interview. But if you&rsquo;re good (on the mound), you give credit to your teammates. If you&rsquo;re horse(bleep), you take all the blame.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>After Butler&rsquo;s next start, a win at Philadelphia, he rattled off thanks as though he had just won an Oscar.</p>
			<p>But why does Hawkins care so much, about how to do an interview, about how to dress, about tipping a bellman?</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Fan Club with something extra</h3>
			<p>It&rsquo;s raining.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a Minneapolis night in 2000, and two Twins fans are outside the Metrodome, hoping to catch a catcher or a shortstop for a signature.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Nobody stopped to sign, but I stopped to sign in the rain &mdash; it seemed like the right thing to do,&rdquo; Hawkins said. &ldquo;We all happened to be in the right place at the right time. That night outside the Metrodome in the rain, the stars lined up.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He had once been a starting pitcher but was now on the journey to becoming a journeyman reliever. Still, Heidi Sutter and Eric Englund still loved LaTroy the Twin &mdash; and soon loved LaTroy the man.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We heard he was a really neat guy, so we just starting chatting,&rdquo; Sutter said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long he stood there with us, talking.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And at the next homestand, Hawkins recalled, &ldquo;They had a big banner &mdash; LATROY HAWKINS FAN CLUB. I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Huh?&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; So every night after the game, I&rsquo;d go meet with them. Every day for three years, I&rsquo;d meet with them after the game.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sutter and Englund founded the fan club, which grew to have more than 1,000 members.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s all just pretty neat. But because this is Hawkins were talking about, what happened next was extraordinary &mdash; yet for him, seemingly ordinary.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So, then we went to a picnic in the summer,&rdquo; he said of the core members of the club. &ldquo;Then my daughter was born, and they would babysit my (older) son. Then we&rsquo;d meet at spring training, and we&rsquo;d play a card game and go to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hawkins has been to their weddings and their funerals.</p>
			<p>He&rsquo;s a godfather to their kids.</p>

			<p>Hawkins has been in the majors for Weiss&rsquo; whole life.</p>
			<p>He has aged annually on the front of Topps baseball cards. He is fresh-faced on his 1995 rookie card, which categorized him on the front as a &ldquo;FUTURE STAR.&rdquo; Never an all-star but always steadfast, the reliable reliever appears on his 2015 card with a face of a man who has endured.</p>
			<p>This spring and summer, numerous fans have asked Hawkins to autograph that final Topps card. He has politely declined. See, he wants there to be just one autographed 2015 LaTroy Hawkins card on the planet. Hawkins is going to sign it and keep it himself, he explained, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m going to save that card for my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
