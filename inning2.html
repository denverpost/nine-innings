			<p>&ldquo;For most kids, it&rsquo;s a double,&rdquo; recalled Darren McKee, president of the Creek Flash youth baseball organization, of this particular hit. &ldquo;And I think Obie was rounding third by the time the kid got to the ball. I mean, it was ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
			 <p>Obie Sanni isn&rsquo;t supposed to have baseball in his life. Or be so wise and humble about his talents at age 13, explaining his desire to &ldquo;live up to Jackie Robinson . . . by becoming great at baseball and representing my family name and representing the African-American race.&rdquo;</p>
			 <p>But life served him a serendipitous twist.</p>
			 <p>When Obie was a toddler, he and his family moved from Nigeria to Colorado. His parents, Ade and Shikrat Sanni, who have six older children, work long hours to stretch their dollars. To them, sports are superfluous.</p>
			 <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s costly. My own mind-set &mdash; we didn&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; said Ade, 60, of paying for Obie to play in youth leagues, for instance.</p>

			<p>But starting at age 7, Obie found baseball through another family, one in which proud African-American men pass down the love of baseball like an heirloom.</p>
			 <p>&ldquo;I want to share this sport with a lot of young black kids,&rdquo; said Ricky Jennings, husband of Stephanie and father of RJ (Ricky Jr.), who is in Obie&rsquo;s grade. &ldquo;A lot of young black kids play football and basketball. My thing is trying to keep the ones who are in it, in it &mdash; and also bring some more players into the sport. It&rsquo;s a sport where they can strive and a sport that&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s kind of like chess. It&rsquo;s strategy. It gets the kids thinking.&rdquo;</p>
			 <p>And so, the Jennings have taken care of Obie as if he&rsquo;s one of their own. For six years, they&rsquo;ve paid for his team registration fees, uniforms, cleats, even eye doctor visits. They drive him to games and teach him the game. Obie estimates he spends about 80 percent of his time at the  Jennings home in southeast Aurora.</p>
			 <p>&ldquo;We really appreciate the family doing that &mdash; we are grateful,&rdquo; Obie&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing. Initially, I was wondering &mdash; how do they do it? I look at myself with time and money, and I find it difficult, even with my (own) kid.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="caption"><span class="photog">Andy Cross, The Denver Post</span>Obie and RJ play multiple positions, though both play shortstop. Thus, sometimes RJ is forced to play second base, which he enjoys as much as eating vegetables.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>&ldquo;You see this kid in need,&rdquo; Stephanie said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the compassion for someone in need. One thing Ricky and I have in common is the love of kids, and you see Obie at 7 years old, and his family is working so hard. Obie&rsquo;s family didn&rsquo;t have a lot of income &mdash; not that we ever did, and our family has sacrificed because of it &mdash; but we&rsquo;re making it better for him. We&rsquo;re not rich. But we felt like if we could do it, we would.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;My dream is to go to Disneyland. I&rsquo;ve never been. I&rsquo;ve been crabby at times for paying for this and this and this, and Ricky says &mdash; &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s about the kids.&rsquo; Ultimately, that&rsquo;s what it should be, making the difference in the life of somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
 
			<h3 class="subheading">Dad makes a big difference</h3>
			 
			<p>It&rsquo;s the late 1980s, and Ricky Jennings stinks at baseball.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In Little League, I was that player at the end of the bench,&rdquo; recalled Jennings, now 38. &ldquo;I used to tell my dad, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done with this.&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Nope.&rsquo;</p>
			 <p>&ldquo;I was trying to get out of baseball, but pops wouldn&rsquo;t let me get out.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Ricky&rsquo;s father was raised in Hayti, Mo. &mdash; St. Louis Cardinals country. He understood baseball. He wasn&rsquo;t going to let his son sneak out of it.</p>
			 <p>And by Ricky&rsquo;s senior season at Overland High School, he had blossomed into a stud. The Milwaukee Brewers drafted him in a late round. But after bouncing from college to college, Ricky&rsquo;s career fizzled. He was never drafted again, never played an inning of professional ball.</p>
			 <p>Even so, he still cherishes the game, forever appreciating how baseball helped him mature from a bench warmer to a star shortstop, from a boy to a man.</p>
			 <p>And now, his own boy is the shortstop.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Every game, you see something that you&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re getting it!&rsquo; &rdquo; Ricky said.</p>
			 <p>RJ is the son of an interracial marriage, and he has played on the same teams with the Nigerian-born Obie for nearly six years. But in their youth leagues, Stephanie said, &ldquo;you can probably count the African-American players on one hand.&rdquo;</p>
			 <p>Baseball is considered the national pastime, but without many African-Americans, is it wholly American?</p>
			 <p>African-American participation in baseball has eroded over the past three decades. USA Today research showed that only 7.8 percent of the players on opening-day rosters this year are African-American, the result of a steady decline from a high-water mark of 27 percent in 1975.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s only one African-American on the Rockies, veteran relief pitcher LaTroy Hawkins. What happened?</p>
 			<p>So many things.</p>
			 <p>For one, the marketing of basketball and football &mdash; and the marketability of their stars &mdash; has catapulted the popularity of those sports in which blacks are a majority of its participants. Basketball and football players drive the rise of their games with every commercial aired or Air Jordan sold.</p>
			 <p>And, in baseball, at the same time the percentage of black players has dropped there has been a corresponding rise in the influx of foreign players. The national pastime is international, with 26.5 percent of the players on opening-day rosters this year foreign born, according to Major League Baseball.</p>
			 <p>In this country youth baseball is no longer as simple as rounding up classmates for a game. Kids who show promise at an early age are asked to join teams that play year-round, traveling the country, which leads to a widening gap between the casual young player who might like to try baseball but not have the financial means to participate with a select team.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think they pushed African-Americans out of the game because they made it so expensive to play,&rdquo; Hawkins said. &ldquo;If I had said, &lsquo;Mom, I want to play on a traveling team. It&rsquo;s $2,200 for the summer&rsquo; &mdash; first of all, I wouldn&rsquo;t have asked her because I knew we didn&rsquo;t have much money &mdash; she would say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to play Little League, where it&rsquo;s $35.&rsquo; &hellip; It&rsquo;s so expensive to play baseball.
			<p>&ldquo;To price a whole race out of a game, it&rsquo;s completely unfair.&rdquo;
			<p>MLB has attempted to reverse the decline in participation among African-Americans with numerous outreach programs, most notably RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities), which is &ldquo;designed to give young people from underserved and diverse communities the opportunity to play baseball and softball.&rdquo; MLB has pumped more than $30 million into the program since 1989, and more than 200 of those participants have been drafted, more than 70 since 2008.</p>
			 <p>But then you think of the 42-year old Hawkins, the lone black player on his team. Or Obie and RJ.</p>
			 <p>They may carry the torch, but the flame is flickering.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">A bond that runs deep </h3>
			 
			<p>If it has the word ball in it, RJ and Obie are playing it &mdash; even paintball &mdash; and if they&rsquo;re not playing sports, they&rsquo;re probably playing sports video games. On Madden, Obie and RJ created a 7-foot, 400-pound running back they call &ldquo;The Refrigerator.&rdquo; </p>
			 <p>They do seemingly everything together. For the Creek Flash, Obie plays shortstop, third base, catcher, pitcher and outfield; RJ plays shortstop, outfield and second base &mdash; &ldquo;They made me play it,&rdquo; he groans, as if he were ordered to eat broccoli. </p>
			 <p>Off the field, Obie will kid RJ about the time RJ ate the entire bag of cookies on a trip; you might catch RJ laughing about Obie&rsquo;s laugh, which Obie described &ldquo;as SpongeBob. Or a dolphin.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>And sometimes, Obie and RJ will fight like, well, brothers.</p>
		 <p>&ldquo;But they care about each other with a bond that other 13-year-olds might not be able to fathom,&rdquo; explained Stephanie in a rare quiet moment in their household. &ldquo;Obie is very outgoing, and RJ is real quiet, but they complement each other. RJ has a lot going on. He has Tourette&rsquo;s, so he has to overcome a lot. And watching him excel, it&rsquo;s really cool. . . . Obie accepts him for who he is. The stuttering parts, sometimes other kids will say something. They&rsquo;ll mostly tease him &mdash; not mean, but they&rsquo;ll kid. . . . But (Obie and RJ) have each other&rsquo;s back, no matter what.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Obie is forever a son of the Sannis. But he&rsquo;ll always be part of the Jennings family.</p>
		 <p>&ldquo;I really want to repay them back in some way,&rdquo; Obie said. &ldquo;I like having the support and having comfort behind me.&rdquo;</p>
